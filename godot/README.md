This does not install Godot directly; instead, it integrates Godot with the desktop environment.

# Usage
    sudo make install
    make help

# What it does:
- Install .desktop file
- Install an icon

It is expected that `godot` is available on your path already.

# Resources
- [Godot Desktop file](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/misc/dist/linux/org.godotengine.Godot.desktop)
- [Godot Icon](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/misc/dist/project_icon.svg)
